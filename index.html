                <p class="text-muted text-left">The new school building is polished and modern making it easier to focus and learn in class. A few of my periods are in the new building so I usally am there for a lot of school. I love staying there, its really easy to navigate through the building with more accomadations like more bathrooms and water fountains. Overall, the new building is a great place to be in while learning, and without it I cant imagine BIS. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Auditorium is a enormus room which has over a hundred seats and a huge stage. The Auditorium is so much differnt from my elementry's auditorium. My elementry's auditorium was just a mid-sized room with no seats while the one in BIS has a huge room with lots of seats and it has lighting for whatever performance that is happening on stage. Thus, the auditorium is very helpful for performances and I am glad that BIS has it.</p>

The Gym is definetley a favorite among the students because of the activities. The activites at the gym are basketball, the mat room, rock climbing, volleyball, batminton, soccer, etc. Overall, the Gym is really fun and BIS is not the same without it!</p>

                <p>In my P.E. class we did the pacer test. All the students would start at a white line and run to another line when a timer starts. If they dont make it therer before the timer beeps they are out. it was really easy at the beginning but it got really hard at the end. At the 50th round almost everyone would be panting for air because the non-stop running was really tuff. I tried my best and almost got 1st, but I was to tired and got 2nd. It was really close because the guy who got 2nd place ended a round after me. I was happy with my rank because getting it was really tuff and I tried my best.</p>

                <p>For the science fair I decided to make my project on germs. I had 3 differnt subjects, not cleaned hands, sanitized hands, and washed hands. I made a comparison on the germs you get on your hands for each one. Of course the not cleaned hands had the msot germs, the sanitizer hands was the 2nd dirtiest, and the washed hands were the cleaniest. The poeple who judged the projects thought mine was good so they rated it 2nd place.</p>

                <p>For the last class of badminton I had they had a tournement. All the students who participated in badminton would do 1v1s to see who was the best out of all the students. It was a brackets with 24 students. I ended up playing my best that day and I was playing really good. Most of the beginning matches were really easy but the ones at the end were really intense. The finals was a really close game, the score being 24 - 22. Since I won I got a bag of candy and the title of "1st place".</p>

                   In effort to let more students join the school BIS made new buildings. The new buildings are extremely clean and neat. Each classroom in the buildings have a tv and a chalkboard. The new buildings are superior to the older ones in every way. The are great for the school and all the students love them.</p>

                    In June of 2021, BIS decided to have a school fundraiser for the people in need. Every time a student walked a lap around the field people would pay 10 cents. This was a great and creative way for BIS to help people in need!</p>
